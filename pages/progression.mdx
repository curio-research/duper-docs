# Progression System

Credits, XP and Levels belong to the progression system in Duper and are associated with a player's profile. They are used to unlock game modes and to determine the rewards you receive.

### Credits

Game credits serve as the wager for Casual mode games. They are only transferred in payouts and cannot be transferred outside a game session.

- 600 credits upon account creation
- 500 credits free to claim every week

### XP

XP is earned from playing games and also from having positive net payout.
