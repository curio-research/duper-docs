# Tournaments

Duper hosts tournaments for players to compete for bigger prizes than regular Ranked games.

## ðŸ¥£ Duper Bowl S5

### Rewards

- **Total Prize Pool**: $3000 will be distributed among all Duper Bowl participants.
- **Distribution**: This season, rewards will be distributed evenly to every participant in stages, rather than just giving prizes to a few winners.
- **Participation Guarantee**: Everyone who shows up will be able to play. No one will be left out because we'll add bots to fill spots if there aren't exactly multiples of 5 people. We'll cover the costs for those bots.

### Registration

- You can register at any time before the tournament begins or during the tournament.
- Minimum registration amount is 10 Chips.
- When you register, you commit to the first game day.

### Top Up

- You can top up a maximum of 120 Chips during any time of the tournaments.
- You can do it at any time when you're not eliminated, and you can make multiple top-ups.
- Registration is basically a top-up, but the minimum to top-up is 10 Chips.
- Minimum to top-up is 10 Chips each time after registration as well.

### Commit and Get Top-up from Duper

- When you register, you commit to the first game day.
- **Commitment & Top up Rules**: If you don't have enough Chips to commit to the next stage, you can top up. If your top-up quota combined with your balance isn't enough to participate in the next stage, you cannot top up. Note: Duper's subsidy doesn't count toward your real tournament account balance.
- **After Day 1 ends**: If you have â‰¥ 40 Chips, you can choose to commit to Day 2.
- **After Day 2 ends**: If you have â‰¥ 100 Chips, you can commit to the final.
- When you commit, you immediately see your tournament balance and how much Duper has topped you up. This amount can change depending on the number of players who commit.
- When the tournament starts, the money Duper gives to you will be added to your real balance.

### Game Day

- **Game Schedule**: First game starts at 9:00 PM UTC sharp, second game starts 3 minutes after all first game matches end, third game starts 3 minutes after all second game matches end.
- **Player Requirements**: You must queue before the game starts to participate.
- **Early Finish**: If you finish a game early, it's recommended to immediately join back the queue for the next game.
- **Bot Fill**: If there aren't a multiple of 5 players, bots will be added to fill the spots. Bot entry fees are subsidized by Duper.
- **AFK Penalty**: If you commit to the game day but do not queue before the tournament starts, your balance will be slashed by the entry fee for that game session. You will also lose Duper's subsidy for that game day.
