### Fragment I: World Genesis

Fragment begins …

First there were two, **eros** and **ovas,** the two primitives of the new unworldly domain Noctharis. Eros resided in the dull-black sand dunes, and ovas near the helix-shaped crimson peaks that spawned like spines of this vast planet. The two were summoned millenniums ago into this world, genetically coded to evolve and form. But due to their deceptive and agitated nature, they fought. For eternity, they remained as primitives and fought in the breeding nests where evolution stalled.

It was only upon an accidental discovery that we received life signals from this unusual planet. Covered with its black dunes, Noctharis remained undetected for centuries from even the most advanced. For long, this region was deemed unworthy of life.

Centuries of scientific research finally deemed a mission to Noctharis worthy, where our researchers have formulated a way to control this new life we believed could be contained. We would build Noctharis to be a planet of wealth and a new domain under human rule.

So the conquest began. Millions of men and machines were sent on year-long orbital missions to probe and explore. But it became much more complicated than the humans have ever predicted …

Noctharis was quickly nicknamed **“The World Full Of Lies”**.
