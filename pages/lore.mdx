### Fragment I: World Genesis

Fragment begins …

In the beginning, there were two: **Eros** and **Ovas**. Two primitive species of an unworldly domain we now call Noctharis. The Eros resided in the dull-black sand dunes while the Ovas sought refuge amongst the helix-shaped peaks that sprouted from the planet like crimson spines.

The two species were not native to Noctharis, but rather, were introduced millenniums ago by parties unknown. Their genetic code revealed that they were designed to evolve, to become something much more. However, due to their deceptive and agitated nature, the two species spent the entirety of their lives fighting the other. For this reason, they remained primitive and fought in the breeding nests where evolution stalled.

It was only upon an accidental discovery that my team and I received life signals from this unusual planet. Noctharis, covered only in its black dunes and crimson spines, remained unremarkable for centuries as even the most advanced scanners detected no signs of life. It was a dead zone, considered unworthy of human interaction.

It was only after centuries of scientific research and technological advancements that the planet was finally deemed worthy of humanity's attention. The discovery of the Eros and Ovas drove the mission to Noctharis, where our researchers have formulated a way to control this new life. With this newfound power, we would build Noctharis to be a planet of wealth and a new domain under human rule.

And so, the conquest began. Millions of men and machines were sent on year-long missions to probe and explore Noctharis. But we soon found out that just like the planet’s origin, there was much more to it than met the eyes. We never could have predicted what came next...

Noctharis was quickly nicknamed **“The World Full Of Lies”**.
