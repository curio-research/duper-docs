## Ranking System Guide

The ranking system is designed to make the game more competitive and rewarding for consistent players. 

### Core Mechanics

Players progress through four main ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Super Duper. Each rank has unique rewards and challenges, with XP determining your progress.

| Rank | Casual Games (Loss/Win/Biggest Earner) | Ranked Games (Loss/Win/Biggest Earner) | Required XP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze | 0 / +1 / +2 | 0/ +2 / +4 | 0-15 |
| Silver | -1 / +1 /+2 | -1 / +2 / +4 | 0-24 |
| Gold | -1 / +1 / +1 | -2 / +2 / +3 | 0-24 |
| Super Duper | No XP | -2 / +1 / +2 | accumulative |

We'll be introducing more ranks in the future, and Super Duper's XP will be inherited to the next rank.

### Relative Difficulty Score (RDS)

The RDS system adjusts XP rewards based on player ranks in each game.

Rank values: Bronze (1), Silver (2), Gold (3), Super Duper (4)

- Example game with 3 Bronze (one winner), 1 Gold (loser), 1 Super Duper (loser)
    - RDS = (1+1+1+4+3) รท 5 = 2
    - Bronze winner bonus: +1 XP
    - Bronze losers won't receive any penalties, as their rank value is below the RDS
    - Gold loser penalties: -1 XP
    - Super Duper loser penalties: -2 XP
    - Higher ranks get penalties when losing

This ensures fair competition between different ranks.
