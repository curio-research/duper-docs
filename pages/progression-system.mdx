## Ranking System Guide

The ranking system is designed to make the game more competitive and rewarding for consistent players. 

### Core Mechanics

Players progress through four main ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Super Duper. Each rank has unique rewards, with XP determining your progress.

| Rank | Casual Games (Loss/Win/Biggest Earner) | Ranked Games (Loss/Win/Biggest Earner) | Required XP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze | 0 / +1 / +2 | 0/ +2 / +4 | 0-15 |
| Silver | -1 / +1 /+2 | -1 / +2 / +4 | 0-24 |
| Gold | -1 / +1 / +1 | -2 / +2 / +3 | 0-24 |
| Super Duper | No XP | -2 / +1 / +2 | cumulative |

We'll be introducing more ranks in the future, and any XP accumulated in Super Duper rank will transfer to future ranks.

### Relative Difficulty Score (RDS)

The RDS (Relative Difficulty Score) works by calculating the average rank value of all players in a game. Each rank has a numerical value:

- Bronze = 1, Silver = 2, Gold = 3, Super Duper = 4

For example, in a game with 3 Bronze players, 1 Gold player, and 1 Super Duper, the RDS would be (1+1+1+4+3) ÷ 5 = 2. This score then determines XP bonuses for lower-ranked players and penalties for higher-ranked players.

Let’s say in that game, a bronze player is the sole winner. They will receie 2 - 1 = 1 XP bonus. The gold player will receive 3 - 2 = 1 XP penalty, and the super duper will receive 4 - 2 = 2 XP penalty.

This ensures fair competition between different ranks.
