# Player Elimination

When a player's capital or supercapital gets destroyed in a battle, the player is eliminated from the game. The following happens:

- The player's troops and buildings are destroyed.
- The player's tiles become inactive, meaning they can no longer be conquered by anyone.
- The player's gems, regardless of their colors, are transferred to the battle counterparty.
  - Because of this, an eliminated player always loses their entire stake, because regardless of the winner, the player would have zero gems of that player's color.
- The player's gold is also transferred to the battle counterparty.
- The player's cards get reshuffled into the deck.
- The player's stakes (Sparks or ETH) remain in the pool to be divided when the game ends.

To avoid being eliminated and losing all your stake, remember to defend your capital and usually also the tiles around it. Upgrading your capital can also help as it increases your capital's health.
