# Terminology

- Duper has two principal components, which we shall refer to as the **_map_** and the **_chat_**.
- A **_tile_** is the main spatial unit of Duper. The **_map_** has 37 tiles in total. A tile may be owned by a player.
- Each of the 5 players start with a **_capital_** on a fixed tile. Red, the middle player, is always the player who has the earliest turn order, and is referred to as the **_dealer_**.
- There are opportunities for players to **_raise_** during a match, which means to put up more entry fee to get more keys of their color.
- A **_round_** is the main temporal unit of Duper. Within each round, players have their **_turns_** in sequence starting from the dealer. A player may attack only during their own turn, but may perform any other action (e.g. trading, production, movement) outside of their turn.
- Tiles may host **_units_**, the umbrella term for **_troops_** and **_buildings_**. At any given time, each tile can host at most 1 class of **_air troop_**, 1 class of **_ground troop_**, and 1 building.
- The main production resources in Duper are **_gold_** (fungible) and **_cards_** (non-fungible). The main diplomatic resource is **_keys_** (semi-fungible).
- Card combos used in production may later trigger **_combo rewards_**.
- For each player, the chat is composed of 4 private **_channels_** with the other 4 players. Resources flow between players through **_trades_** that get proposed and accepted in those channels.
- When a player meets an **_end condition_**, the match ends and the prize vault changes to that player's color. The prize is then divided as payouts to the players based on ownership of keys of the vault's color.
