# Special Cards

Special cards are consumable cards players own in the Duper ecosystem. They may be used in sessions to gain advantages. To use it, the player also needs to raise by 60% of the lowest entry stake, and this time no new gems are minted by the player.

There are currently 3 classes of special cards:
