# Chat and Diplomacy Features

If the map feels like the conventional war game grind, the chat is anything but. It is where key resources are exchanged, information and conspiracies spread, and alliances get forged and broken by the minute.

For each player, the chat is composed of 4 private channels with the other 4 players respectively. Each private channel is therefore between 2 players only, and no new players can be added to any channel. In these channels go two things: messages and trades.
