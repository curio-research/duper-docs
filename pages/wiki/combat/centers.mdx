# Center Focuses

When a center is completed, powerful abilities are unlocked for players that give them an edge in the game. Below are the center focuses in Duper:

| Center Focus     | Ability                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Economy        | trade with non-bordering players unlocked + 1 extra gold yield per round + ability to host Economic Conference |
| Plane | Player gets 1 free plane                                                                                      |
| Fort  | Player gets 1 free fort                                                                                       |

A player may research 1 of 3 center focuses in a newly built center, provided that the player does not already have another center dedicated to the same center focus. For example, if a player already has 2 plane centers (presumably, 1 of them is taken from another player because the player cannot have built 2 plane centers) and 1 economy center, the player may only build 1 more center and can only choose fort as the center focus.

A player's first center focus takes 2 rounds to activate; second takes 4 rounds; third takes 5 rounds. This is not affected by how many centers of the same center focus the player may have conquered from other players. In the above case, the fort center would take 5 rounds to activate.

### Economic Conference

A player with an active economy may host an Economic Conference: spending a required combo of cards (pair, flush, straight, and finally three of a kind) to get 5 gold. A player may only host an economic conference four times.
