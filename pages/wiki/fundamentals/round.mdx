# Rounds and Turns

A player may only attack during their own turn, but may perform any other action such as production or trading outside of their turn. A session starts from Round 1. In each round, starting from the dealer, each player has their turn in a fixed sequence.

Turns are shorter in early game and longer in late game. Each player can request for 20 additional seconds for a turn once in a game.

When a round begins, the following happens:

- Combo reward round is advanced, and rewards set to the current round are triggered and refreshed;
- Discarded cards from last round return to dealing deck;
- Players get round-based gold yields;
- Each player draws a card (except in Round 1);
- Each player's energy is incremented;
- Building rounds are advanced, potentially unlocking talents and their abilities.

When a player’s turn starts:

- The player’s turn-based stats including attack points are incremented;
- The player’s troops recover their full movement stamina.
