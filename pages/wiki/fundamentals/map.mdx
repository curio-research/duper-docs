# Map

The map is composed of 37 tiles. A tile may be level 1, 2, or 3. There are 20-28 level-1 tiles, 12-16 level-2 tiles, and 4-8 level-3 tiles. The center and corner tiles where players spawn are always level-1 tiles; the other tile levels are randomized. Tile levels don’t change.

When a session begins, except the 5 tiles where player capitals spawn, all other tiles have barbarians on them. A level-1 tile has 1 barbarian infantry; a level-2 tile has 3 barbarian infantry; a level-3 tile has 2-3 barbarian tanks.

A tile’s level and the unit classes on top are visible to players if and only if one of the players owns a tile that is adjacent. A player can see who owns any tile, but does not know the number of troops stationed on any tile except their own. This is a core element of deception — you may tell another player that you own 50 infantries on a valuable tile when you actually just have 1.
