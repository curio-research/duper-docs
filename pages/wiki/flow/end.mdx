# End Conditions

There are 4 ways to end a match in Duper:

1. Tile Count End: The player owns the number of tiles required to end the game. The specific number varies by map, and is shown in the Objective panel.
2. Straight Flush End: The player holds a 5-card straight flush.
3. Last Man Standing End: The player is the only player who has neither been eliminated nor quit
4. Round Limit End: The player with the most tiles is considered the game ender at the end of round 12. In case of a tie, the player earlier in turn order is considered the game ender.

When a player meets one of the above conditions, the session ends and payouts are distributed.
