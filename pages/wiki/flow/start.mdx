# Start

After the session official starts, players are spawn with the following stats:

- The dealer’s initial level-1 tile and capital is at the center of the map, while the others spawn on level-1 tiles at the four corners of the map;
- Each player is given 5 infantries at the capital tile;
- The dealer starts with 13 gems, 2 of which are given to a random player, while the others each start with 10 gems, 1 of which is given to a random player;
- The dealer starts with 5 gold while the others start with 2;
- The dealer starts with 2 attack points while the others start with 1;

As you can see, The dealer has a slight advantage. In addition to being geographically better poised for diplomacy, the dealer starts with more gems, gold, and attack points. It comes with a tradeoff though — being surrounded by the other players, the dealer is often more vulnerable to attacks.
