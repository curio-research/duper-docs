# Bidding for Dealership

Before a session starts, players place bids for the dealer role (i.e. the middle player) in a sealed second-price auction.

The minimum bid is the buy-in price, and the maximum bid is twice that. For example, in a game with 0.005 ETH buy-in, a player may bid between 0.005 and 0.01 ETH, and in a game with 100 Sparks buy-in, between 100 and 200 Sparks.

Players place bids hidden to everyone else, and the bids are revealed together once everyone has done so. The player who ends up bidding the highest amount becomes the dealer, and their buy-in would be equal in amount to the second-highest bid. If multiple players end up placing the highest bid, one of them is randomly chosen to be the dealer, and their buy-in would be equal in amount to the highest bid. The other players' buy-ins would all be equal in amount to the lowest bid.

### Why aim for the dealer role in the first place?

Generally, being the dealer has more benefits than tradeoffs, but playing the dealer well is also harder than playing a non-dealer. Therefore, the advice to a beginner is to simply bid the lowest so to not aim for the dealer role in particular, until you are more familiar with the game, especially the dynamics of diplomacy.
