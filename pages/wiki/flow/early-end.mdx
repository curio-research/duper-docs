# Early End

There are two ways a session ends early for a player, namely if

1. The player is [eliminated](/wiki/war/elimination)—the player’s capital gets destroyed in a battle; or
2. The player quits, by quite literally pressing the “Quit” button.
   - Quitting is a way to get some prize money in early game if a player has a bad start. Specifically, a player gets an amount worth $\min\left((0.8-\frac{\text{round \#}}{5}+\frac{\text{owned gems from others\#}}{20}) \times 100\%, 100\%\right)$ of their entry fee from the prize pool when they quit.

In both cases, all of the player’s tiles except the capital tile permanently disappear from the session, along with all units on those tiles. Such a player exit usually shifts the diplomatic situation quite a bit, and at the very least makes Tile Count Victory more attainable for others. The dead player enters spectator mode until the session ends or the player leaves the page.
