# Early End

There are two ways a session ends early for a player, namely if

1. The player is eliminated — the player’s capital gets destroyed in a battle; or
2. The player quits, by quite literally pressing the “Quit” button.
   - Quitting is a way to get some stake back in early game if a player has a bad start. Specifically, a player gets $(1-\frac{\text{round \#}}{5}+\frac{\text{owned gem \#}}{20}) \times 100\%$ of their stake back when they quit.

In both cases, all of the player’s tiles except the capital tile permanently disappear from the session, along with all units on those tiles. Such a player exit usually shifts the diplomatic situation quite a bit, and at the very least makes Tile Count Victory more attainable for others. The dead player enters spectator mode until the session ends.
