# Early End

There are two ways a session ends early for a player, namely if

1. The player is [eliminated](/wiki/war/elimination)—the player’s capital gets destroyed in a battle; or
2. The player quits, by quite literally pressing the “Quit” button. Players who quits during mid-game will not get their sparks/chips back.

In both cases, all of the player’s tiles except the capital tile permanently disappear from the session, along with all units on those tiles. Such a player exit usually shifts the diplomatic situation quite a bit, and at the very least makes Tile Count Victory more attainable for others. The dead player enters spectator mode until the session ends or the player leaves the page.
