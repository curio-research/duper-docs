# Settlement Conditions

There are 3 Settlement Conditions in Duper:

1. Tile Count Condition: The player owns $12-(\text{\# dead players})$ tiles.
   - e.g. a player owns 10 tiles when there are 3 surviving players, 1 player whoâ€™s eliminated, and 1 player who has quit
2. Straight Flush Condition: The player holds a 5-card straight flush.
3. Last Man Standing Condition: The player is the only player who has neither been eliminated nor quit.

When a player meets one of the above conditions, the session ends and payouts are distributed.
