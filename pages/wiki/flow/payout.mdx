# Payout

When a victory condition is triggered, the session ends, and payouts are settled based on player stakes and gem distribution as follows:

- The victor first gets their entire stake back, including raised stake if any.
- Then, the rest of the pot is divided into $N$ equal chunks where $N$ is the number of total gems minted by the victor. The chunks are then distributed to the current owners of the victor-minted gems.

> Example: Suppose the 5 players are called A B C D E, and each player stakes 10 and the total pot is 50. Suppose nobody raises for simplicity's sake. B ends up winning when A owns 4 of B-minted gems, B owns 2, C owns 3, D owns 1, and E owns 0. B takes 10 first. The remaining $50-10=40$ is divided into 10 chunks each of $40\div10=4$. In this process, A gets $4\times4=16$; B gets 8; C gets 12; D gets 4; E gets nothing. In total, A earns $16-10=6$; B earns 8; C earns 2; D loses 6; E loses 10. A small 5% game fee is incurred on those whose net payout is positive.
