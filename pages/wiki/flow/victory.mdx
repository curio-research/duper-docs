# Victory Conditions

There are 4 Victory Conditions in Duper:

1. Tile Count Victory: The player owns $11-(\text{\# dead players})$ tiles.
   - e.g. a player owns 10 tiles when there are 3 surviving players, 1 player whoâ€™s eliminated, and 1 player who has quit
2. Straight Flush Victory: The player holds a 5-card straight flush.
3. Last Man Standing Victory: The player is the only player who has neither been eliminated nor quit
4. 16-Round Victory: The player with the most tiles wins at the end of round 12. In case of a tie, the player earlier in turn order wins.

When a player meets one of the above conditions, the session ends and payouts are distributed.
