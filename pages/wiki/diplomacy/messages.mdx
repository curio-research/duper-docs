# Messages

Two players can only send each other at most one templated message until they trade at least once. The first trade immediately unlocks unlimited messaging. Generally, sending anything is ok in messages except external links and clearly harmful speech.

Lying, however, is not only okay but expected. Think twice, for example, when someone claims to help you win but hesitates to exchange any gems with you.
