# Messages

Messaging with other players is the core medium of social maneuvering in Duper. It is where you can exchange information, forge alliances, and make deals and demands with other players. Don't underestimate what plain language can do.

Two players can only send each other at most one templated message until they trade at least once. This is to encourage trading. The first trade immediately unlocks unlimited messaging.

Generally, sending anything is ok in messages except external links and clearly harmful speech. Lying is not only okay but expected. Think twice, for example, when someone claims to help you win but hesitates to exchange any gems with you â€” maybe they're secretly plotting with another player to raid your capital and steal your gems!
