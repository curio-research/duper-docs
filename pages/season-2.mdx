# Season II

Season II starts on Monday, October 7, 2024 and will run for 6 weeks. It comes with major game upgrades, new season passes, renewed quests, and more! Read below for details.

What hasn't changed? The core gameplay of Duper remains the same, the [referral](./referral.mdx) program is still active and lucrative as always.

## Game Upgrades

As in every season, Duper comes with a big update in Season II. New models for the dealer camp are introduced. In-game cards now have a new look. Many long-awaited features, such as battle log and chess notation, are added. Check out the #patchnotes channel in Discord for details.

## Season Passes

Season II introduces two new season passes: Level 1 Season Pass and Level 2 Season Pass. Having a Season Pass activates your Duper account forever, allowing you to earn Sparks from games and quests as well as to sell them for profit if you wish.

The Level 1 Season Pass is a great place to start for Casual games and completing quests. The Level 2 Season Pass provides extra ETH rewards for Ranked gameplay.

## Sparks Buy & Sell

Starting in Season II, you can sell Sparks back to the store given that you have activated your Duper account with a Season Pass. This allows you to translate earning in Casual mode directly to real money income, where 100 Sparks will approximately be worth \$1. Sparks buying and selling are done in batches of 1,600 Sparks.

- Buy price: 1,600 Sparks for 0.0067 ETH (\~$17.6)
- Sell price: 1,600 Sparks for 0.0055 ETH (\~$14.4)
  - Each sell needs to be approved by the Duper team, taking up to 3 days.
  - Each player can sell up to 8,000 Sparks per season. If you have purchased Sparks this season, the limit is raised by the amount you have purchased.

## Ranked Vouchers

A Ranked voucher serves as a ticket to play a Ranked game, equivalent in value to 0.005 ETH. You can buy them using Sparks from the store.

- Can be purchased once per week
- Price: 1,300 Sparks
- Can only be purchased if you have a Season Pass of either level
- Each voucher expires after 1 week if not used

## Quests & Weekly Claims

A total of 7,600 Sparks can be earned from quests and weekly claims in Season II. They are unlocked after purchasing the Season Pass of either level.
