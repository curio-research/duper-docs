# S2 Tournament

S2 tournament is here! The tournament will start on Wednesday, November 13th, and end on December 4th. We have designed the tournament to be very beginner-friendly. All you need to do as a new player is to learn the game and play well.

The Season 2 Beginner Tournament has been extended to provide new players and guilds with more time to activate their accounts by purchasing a Season Pass. The Level 1 Season Pass, required for activation, is available at a limited-time 50% discount for just 0.005 ETH.

If you're new to Duper, start from the [Quick Start](../index) page.

## Stage 1: 2-Week Buildup

- Guild selection
  - Each player can opt into a guild via a drop-down menu once. This is not required, as players without guilds are eligible to earn from individual leaderboards. For each player, their gameplay starts contributing to their guild's score from the moment they opt in.
  - Players cannot switch guilds.
  - There is no upper limit on the number of players in a guild.
- Players who have played 10+ ranked/casual games in S1 and S2 are classified as "old players", and can participate in the tournament the same. However, to give new players a chance, all old players' scores towards themselves and their guilds will only start counting in the 2nd week of the tournament.

### Leaderboard score calculation
  - Individual player score calculation
    - Casual game: payout
    - Ranked game: (payout / 0.005 ETH) \* 1000
    - Activated (i.e. owns Season Pass) player multiplier: 3x for all games played by this player
    - Example: A is activated and has played 5 casual games with 120 Sparks payout each. B is not activated and has played 2 ranked games with 0.004 ETH payout each.
      - A's score: 120 \* 5 \* 3 = 1800 points
      - B's score: 0.004 \* 2 / 0.005 \* 1000 = 1600 points
  - Guild score calculation
    - If guild has \<=5 active players: The guild score is simply the sum of all its players' scores.
    - If guild has \>5 active players: The top 5 players in each guild, ranked by score, still get directly added up to the guild score. Players 6-25 have their scores multiplied by (25-_i_)/20, where _i_ is the player's score rank within the guild. This is to give smaller guilds a chance while still counting significant contributions to additional players in larger guilds.
    - Example: The 10th player in a large guild will have their score multiplied by (25-10)/20 = 0.75 when added to the guild score.
