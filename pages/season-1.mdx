To learn more about Duper, read the [Quick Start](.) page first.

## Gameplay Rewards

Season I comes with official ETH and Sparks rewards from gameplay in addition to what you earn from games.

If you're new to Duper, start with Quests. If you've been playing for a bit, pay attention to leaderboard rewards, Season I Pass, and tournaments.

### Quests

Earn Sparks through completing quests. If you're new, quests are a great way to learn Duper while earning Sparks. Check out the details on the "Quests" tab of the game website.

### Leaderboards

Large reward pools composed of ETH and Sparks are dedicated every week for the top players on 7-day Ranked, Casual, and Referral leaderboards. Check out the "Leaderboard" tab of the game website for the prize pool this week.

### Season I Pass

The Season I Pass is a guaranteed way to make money and earn Sparks for staying active in the season. Each Pass costs 0.05 ETH. As a Pass owner, you get ETH and Sparks at the following milestones:

- Ranked games only -> total 0.1 ETH (0.05 ETH profit) if completed
  - After 10 Ranked games -> 0.01 ETH
  - After 20 Ranked games -> 0.02 ETH
  - After 30 Ranked games -> 0.03 ETH
  - After 40 Ranked games -> 0.04 ETH and "Season I Warrior" badge of honor
- Ranked, Casual, or Custom games -> total 2000 Sparks if completed
  - After 10 games -> 200 Sparks
  - After 20 games -> 400 Sparks
  - After 30 games -> 600 Sparks
  - After 40 games -> 800 Sparks

During Preseason, most active players on average played 4 Ranked games a day, 2 days a week, and 4 weeks per month, which makes 32 games a month. Given Season I lasts 2 months, 40 games is a very attainable goal. Plus, you only need to play 30 games to earn from the Pass, not to mention the Sparks earned.

If you are new to Duper and aren't yet ready to commit to Ranked games, don't worry â€” there will be season passes in upcoming seasons too.

### Ranked Vouchers

A Ranked voucher acts as ETH credit for your next Ranked game. The value of a voucher never exceeds the buy-in for a Ranked game. Each voucher is valid for 1 week.

You may get vouchers via raffles in one of 2 ways:

1. When you have negative net payout (i.e. lose money) in a Ranked game.
2. When you have played lots of Casual games.

### Tournaments

Compete for large pools of ETH and Sparks in public and private tournaments. Stay tuned on Twitter and/or the game website.

## Lootboxes and Emblems

Season I reveals [Emblems](/assets/emblems), the first tradable utility asset in Duper. There are 4 tiers of Emblems: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary. The specific Emblems and their utility will be announced at the end of Season I.

Lootboxes open up to an Emblem or Sparks. A level 2 lootbox guarantees a Common Emblem; level 3 guarantees an Uncommon Emblem; level 4 guarantees a Rare Emblem. Lootboxes are not transferrable. Lootboxes can be opened at the end of Season I as Emblems are revealed.

Claim your lootbox on the home page of game website. To claim a Lootbox,

- Link Twitter and repost the Season I tweet
- Link Discord
- Win in Playground

Upgrading your Lootbox has the following Sparks costs:

- Level 1 -> 2: 1200 Sparks
- Level 2 -> 3: 3200 Sparks
- Level 3 -> 4: 4000 Sparks

## Referral Rewards

The [Duper referral program](/referral) is in effect as Season I starts, though it's a separate, persistent campaign that won't end with the season. Onboard people and earn massive rewards if they become active Duper players.

## Community Rewards

Sparks and ETH rewards are given to those who create useful text and video content, distributed retroactively. The Discord "Pioneer" role, which comes with long-term privileges in the ecosystem, is reserved for the most active players who also act to help others learn and succeed in Duper.
