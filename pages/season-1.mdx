# Season I

Welcome to Duper Alpha Season I! The season has kicked off on August 6, 2024 and is officially live today. A fresh set of gameplay rewards are back, referral rewards are activated, and two valuable assets are introduced. There’s no better time to play Duper, invite friends, and earn rewards.

If you're new to Duper, read the [Quick Start](.) page first.

## Sparks

Sparks are an important in-game currency in Duper alongside real ETH. You earn Sparks by playing games, achieving quests, and inviting people, and can spend them to upgrade your lootbox. Sparks are currently not transferrable. There will be more utility for Sparks later on as Duper evolves. Both your current Sparks and your lifetime Sparks earned will be tracked, the latter serving as one of the metrics of progression in the Duper ecosystem.

## Gameplay Rewards

Season I comes with official ETH and Sparks rewards from gameplay in addition to what you earn from games.

If you're new to Duper, start with Quests. If you've been playing for a bit, pay attention to leaderboard rewards, Season I Pass, and tournaments.

### Quests

Earn Sparks through completing quests. If you're new, quests are a great way to learn Duper while earning Sparks. Check out the details on the "Quests" tab of the game website.

### Leaderboards

Large reward pools composed of ETH and Sparks are dedicated every week for the top players on 7-day Ranked, Casual, and Referral leaderboards. Check out the "Leaderboard" tab of the game website for the prize pool this week.

### Season I Pass

The Season I Pass is a guaranteed way to make money and earn Sparks for staying active in the season. Each Pass costs 0.05 ETH. As a Pass owner, you get ETH and Sparks at the following milestones:

- Ranked games only -> total 0.1 ETH (0.05 ETH cost-deducted profit) if completed
  - After 10 Ranked games -> 0.01 ETH
  - After 20 Ranked games -> 0.02 ETH
  - After 30 Ranked games -> 0.03 ETH
  - After 40 Ranked games -> 0.04 ETH and "Pass Perfectionist" badge of honor
- Ranked, Casual, or Custom games -> total 2000 Sparks if completed
  - After 10 games -> 200 Sparks
  - After 20 games -> 400 Sparks
  - After 30 games -> 600 Sparks
  - After 40 games -> 800 Sparks

The "Pass Perfectionist" honor, given only to players who complete all the milestones of the Season I Pass, will entitle you to a special Rare emblem that cannot be obtained in any other way, as well as guaranteed discount for the next season's pass.

Some context for the milestones: During Preseason, most active players on average played 4 Ranked games a day, 2 days a week, and 4 weeks per month, which makes 32 games a month. Some played a lot more. Given Season I lasts 2 months, 40 games is a very attainable goal. Plus, you only need to play 30 games to earn from the Pass, not to mention the Sparks earned.

If you are new to Duper and aren't yet ready to commit to Ranked games, don't worry, just get your reps in — there will be season passes in upcoming seasons.

### Ranked Vouchers

A Ranked voucher acts as ETH credit for your next Ranked game. The value of a voucher never exceeds the buy-in for a Ranked game. Each voucher is valid for 1 week.

You may get vouchers via raffles in one of 2 ways:

1. When you have negative net payout (i.e. lose money) in a Ranked game.
2. When you have played lots of Casual games.

### Tournaments

Compete for large pools of ETH and Sparks in public and private tournaments. Stay tuned on Twitter and/or the game website.

If you wish to run a private Duper tournament for your offline/online community, reach out to the team and we're happy to help coordinate.

## Lootboxes and Emblems

Season I reveals [Emblems](/assets/emblems), the first tradable utility asset in Duper. There are 4 tiers of Emblems: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary. The specific Emblems and their utility will be announced at the end of Season I.

Each account can claim up to 1 Lootbox. Each Lootbox opens up to an Emblem or Sparks. Lootboxes are not transferrable. Lootboxes can be opened at the end of Season I as Emblems are revealed.

1. A level 1 Lootbox opens up to Sparks or at most a Common Emblem. Hence, it is meant to be a free-to-play lootbox without supply limit.
2. A level 2 guarantees a Common Emblem.
3. A level 3 guarantees an Uncommon Emblem.
4. A level 4 guarantees a Rare Emblem.

To claim your Lootbox,

- Link Twitter and repost the Season I tweet
- Link Discord and join Duper server
- Win in Playground

Upgrading your Lootbox has the following Sparks costs:

- Level 1 -> 2: 1200 Sparks
- Level 2 -> 3: 3200 Sparks
- Level 3 -> 4: 4000 Sparks

## Referral Rewards

The [Duper referral program](/referral) is in effect as Season I starts, though it's a separate, persistent campaign that won't end with the season. Onboard people and earn massive rewards if they become active Duper players. Read more on the program page.

## Pioneer Program

If you’re an active Duper player, we highly encourage you to make content that will help others discover Duper and improve gameplay, and we will appreciate you for doing so. Duper Pioneer roles will be assigned every few weeks for active players making high-quality content. The Pioneer role comes with privileges including exclusive early access and alpha, badges on Duper profile, and special priority of the team’s time and energy. The best content may also be featured on the official website, X, and Discord.

Examples of content include, but are not limited to:

- Game videos and streams on X, YouTube, and/or Twitch
- Strategy posts and threads on X, Discord and/or Reddit
- “Office Hour” Custom games with new players in Discord voice
- Thorough responses to player questions in Discord

You may notice the slight overlap between the [referral program](/referral) and the Pioneer program. That is because we wish to reward people who go above and beyond contributing to the ecosystem, whether it's bringing new people, helping existing players improve, or both.
