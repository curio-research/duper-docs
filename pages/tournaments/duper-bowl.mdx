### Commit and Get Top-up from Duper

- When you register, you commit to the first game day.
- **Commitment & Top up Rules**: If you don't have enough Chips to commit to the next stage, you can top up. If your top-up quota combined with your balance isn't enough to participate in the next stage, you cannot top up. Note: Duper's subsidy doesn't count toward your real tournament account balance.
- **After Day 1 ends**: If you have â‰¥ 40 Chips, you can choose to commit to Day 2.
- **After Day 2 ends**: If you have â‰¥ 100 Chips, you can commit to the final.
- When you commit, you immediately see your tournament balance and how much Duper has topped you up. This amount can change depending on the number of players who commit.
- When the tournament starts, the money Duper gives to you will be added to your real balance.

### Game Day

- **Game Schedule**: First game starts at 1 PM UTC sharp, second game starts 3 minutes after all first game matches end, third game starts 3 minutes after all second game matches end.
- **Player Requirements**: You must queue before the game starts to participate.
- **Early Finish**: If you finish a game early, it's recommended to immediately join back the queue for the next game.
- **Bot Fill**: If there aren't a multiple of 5 players, bots will be added to fill the spots. Bot entry fees are subsidized by Duper.
- **AFK Penalty**: If you commit to the game day but do not queue before the tournament starts, your balance will be slashed by the entry fee for that game session. You will also lose Duper's subsidy for that game day.
