### Playground

A simplified mode where you 1v1 with an AI. It is meant for you to learn basic actions such as producing, attacking, and trading. Understandably, the strategic depth is quite shallow compared to games with real players. You can play Playground mode any number of times.

### Casual

Play with game credits against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The minimum stake is 100 [Credits](./xp#credits). Casual mode is unlocked at Level 1 â€” after you win a game in Playground mode.

Currently, Casual mode is only open during preset game windows. Check the [game website](https://play.duper.gg) for the next game windows and book there if you'd like to play.

### Ranked

Play with real money against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The current minimum stake for a Ranked session is 0.005 ETH. There is a 5% game fee on the pot, the majority of which is distributed back to the community as rewards. Ranked mode is unlocked at Level 2.

As the name entails, the top players of Ranked mode by revenue are ranked on the leaderboard. The majority of rewards are concentrated on Ranked mode players.

Like Casual mode above, Ranked mode is also only open during preset game windows. Check and book on the [game website](https://play.duper.gg).

### Private

This is a mode for you to play with your friends. Set custom minimum stake and invite specific people to play. The game fee is 3% in Private games.
