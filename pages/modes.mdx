### Ranked

Ranked mode is the main game mode of Duper. Play for real money prizes against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The current minimum entry fee for a Ranked session is 10 chips (10 usd equivalent).

### Casual

Casual mode is a more beginner-friendly game mode to get practice before playing Ranked. Play with _Sparks_ (read more [here](./assets/sparks)) against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. Sparks are the virtual entry fee as well as prize pool units for Casual mode, and the minimum entry fee is 100 Sparks.

Note that if you haven't activated your account via a Season Pass, you cannot cash out your Sparks.

### Custom

Custom mode is for you to play with people you know. Set custom entry fees and invite specific people to play. If you don't have a party of 5 for a Custom Sparks game, select "Fill with Bots" to have a few rule-based AI agents fill the remaining spots; the Sparks would be virtual in that case.

Custom mode is also used for private tournaments.

### Playground

In Playground mode, you 1v1 with a rule-based AI agent. You can learn basic actions such as producing, attacking, and trading. The strategic depth in Playground mode is shallow compared to games with real players. You can play Playground any number of times.
