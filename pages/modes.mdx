### Playground

A simplified mode where you 1v1 with an AI. It is meant for you to learn basic actions such as producing, attacking, and trading. Understandably, the strategic depth is quite shallow compared to games with real players. You can play Playground mode any number of times.

### Casual

Play with _Sparks_ against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. Sparks are the virtual wager for Casual mode, and the entry stake is 100 Sparks. Sparks are only transferred in payouts and cannot be transferred outside a game session.

You get more Sparks in the following ways:

- 300 Sparks upon account creation
- 100 Sparks available for claiming every 24 hours
  - Can only claim when you have fewer than 1,000 Sparks

Currently, Casual mode is only open during preset game windows. Check the [official website](https://play.duper.gg) for the next game windows and book there if you'd like to play.

### Ranked

Play with real money against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The current entry stake for a Ranked session is 0.005 ETH. There is a 5% game fee on the pot, the majority of which is distributed back to the community as rewards.

As the name entails, the top players of Ranked mode by revenue are ranked on the leaderboard. The majority of rewards are concentrated on Ranked mode players.

Like Casual mode above, Ranked mode is also only open during preset game windows. Check and book on the [official website](https://play.duper.gg).

### Custom

This is a mode for you to play with your friends. Set custom entry stake and invite specific people to play. The game fee is 3% in Custom games.
