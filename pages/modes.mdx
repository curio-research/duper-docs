### Ranked

Ranked mode is the main game mode of Duper. Play with real money against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The current entry stake for a Ranked session is 0.005 ETH ($18 USD), but there will be opportunities to play higher-stake games during tournaments. There is a 5% game fee on the pot, the majority of which is distributed back to the community as rewards.

Ranked mode is only open during preset game windows. Register on the [official website](https://www.duper.gg) to participate.

### Casual

Casual mode is a more beginner-friendly game mode to get practice before playing Ranked. Play with _Sparks_ against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. Sparks are the virtual wager for Casual mode, and the entry stake is 100 Sparks. Sparks are only transferred in payouts and cannot be transferred outside a game session.

To get more Sparks, check out [Season I](/season-1) for ways to earn them.

Casual mode is also only open during preset game windows. Check out the [official website](https://www.duper.gg) for the next game windows.

### Custom

Custom mode is for you to play with people you know, like how you would play Poker at a friend's house. Set custom entry stake and invite specific people to play. The game fee is 3% in Custom games.

Custom mode is also used for closed-door tournaments. More on this later.

### Playground

Playground is a simplified mode where you 1v1 with an AI. It is for you to learn basic actions such as producing, attacking, and trading. Understandably, the strategic depth is quite shallow compared to games with real players. You can play Playground any number of times.
