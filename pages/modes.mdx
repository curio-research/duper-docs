# Game Modes

We have three main game modes (Ranked, Casual, and Custom) plus a Playground for beginners. Each mode offers a unique experience tailored to different playstyles and skill levels.

Please be aware of Duper's [Community Rules](./community-rules) especially when playing Ranked or Casual.

### 🏆 Ranked

The main event! Compete against 4 other players in random matchmaking for real money prizes. Entry fee: 2 Chips (\$2).

### 🎮 Casual

Perfect for practice and fun! A more beginner-friendly mode with lower stakes (0.1 Chip/\$0.1). Great for honing your skills before diving into Ranked.

### 🎪 Custom

Host your own game! Custom mode lets you play with friends and set your own rules. Perfect for private parties or practice sessions.

#### 🤖 AI Bots

Need to fill empty spots? Our AI bots are here to help! They're decent at battles and resource management but won't outsmart you in strategy or diplomacy.

Note: In games with bots, human players' collective pre-fee net payout is adjusted to zero. Here's how it works:

_Example: Alice, Bob, Cindy, bot1, and bot2 played a game. Their pre-fee net payouts were 100, 0, -40, 0, -60. Since humans collectively earned 60, each human takes a 20 loss. Final adjusted payouts: 80, -20, -60._

### 🎯 Playground

Your training ground! Playground mode features prescripted scenarios with AI bots to help you master the basics, such as production, combat, trading, and more.

While not a competitive mode, it's the perfect place to learn the ropes before jumping into the real action.
