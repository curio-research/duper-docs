### Ranked

Ranked mode is the main game mode of Duper. Play with real money against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The current entry stake for a Ranked session is 0.005 ETH (\~$13 USD), but there will be opportunities to play higher-stake games during tournaments.

Ranked mode is only open during preset game windows. Register on the [game website](https://www.duper.gg) to participate.

### Casual

Casual mode is a more beginner-friendly game mode to get practice before playing Ranked. Play with _Sparks_ (read more [here](./sparks.mdx)) against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. Sparks are the virtual wager for Casual mode, and the entry stake is 100 Sparks. Sparks are only transferred in payouts and cannot be transferred outside a game session.

Note that if you haven't activated your account, your Spark balance doesn't actually change, and you can play up to 20 Casual games.

Casual mode is also only open during preset game windows. Check out the [game website](https://www.duper.gg) for the next game windows.

### Custom

Custom mode is for you to play with people you know, like how you would play Poker at a friend's house. Set custom buy-in and invite specific people to play. If you don't have a party of 5 for a Custom Sparks game, select "Fill with Bots" to have a few rule-based AI agents fill the remaining spots; the Sparks would be virtual in that case.

Custom mode is also used for private tournaments. More on this later.

### Playground

Playground is a simplified mode where you 1v1 with a rule-based AI agent. It is for you to learn basic actions such as producing, attacking, and trading. Understandably, the strategic depth is quite shallow compared to games with real players. You can play Playground any number of times.
