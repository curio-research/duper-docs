# Game Modes

There are 3 game modes in Duper: Ranked, Casual, and Custom. Ranked is the main mode. There is also a Playground mode for you to get started with.

Please be aware of Duper's [Community Rules](./community-rules) especially when playing Ranked or Casual.

### Ranked

Ranked mode is the main game mode of Duper. Play for real money prizes against 4 other players found from random matchmaking. The current minimum entry fee for a Ranked session is 10 Chips (\$10).

### Casual

Casual mode is a more beginner-friendly game mode to get practice for lower stakes before playing Ranked. Play against 4 other players found from random matchmaking.

### Custom

Custom mode is for you to play with people you know, great for private parties. Simply set a custom entry fee and invite specific people to play.

#### Bots

If you don't have a party of 5 for a Custom game, select "Fill with Bots" to have a few rule-based AI bots fill the remaining spots. These bots are okay at battles and resource management but not at strategic planning or diplomacy.

Note that the collective pre-fee net payout of human players are adjusted to zero in each game regardless of whether the bots earned or lost money.

_Example: Alice, Bob, Cindy, bot1, and bot2 played, with pre-fee net payouts of 100, 0, -40, 0, -60. Humans collectively earned 60, so each human would take 60 / 3 = 20 loss. The adjusted pre-fee net payouts would therefore be 80, -20, -60._

### Playground

In Playground mode, you play with one or a few rule-based AI bots in prescripted scenarios. You can learn basic actions such as producing, attacking, and trading. Playground is a great way to learn the game but not a competitive mode for the full experience.
