# Season IV
Duration: Jan 28, 2025 to April 28, 2025

## ðŸª™ Chips

Chips will be used as the "real-money" currency in ranked games. 1 chip = 1 USD.
You can purchase chips directly with ETH, or you can exchange chips with sparks. Chips are withdrawable to ETH as well. 

## ðŸŽ« Season Pass

Both passes offer real-money rewards, and they provide many other benefits that are essential for players who would like to commit to the season.

Progress towards quests and ranked game milestones is tracked from the start of the season, regardless of pass ownership. All rewards can be claimed retroactively upon purchasing a pass.

However, it is recommended to purchase a pass early so that you can enjoy the other benefits immediately.
