# Season IV

Duration: Tuesday, Jan 28, 2025 to Tuesday, April 22, 2025 (12 weeks)

## What's New?

We're launching the new season on Abstract. Play duper and earn abstract points! (more details will release soon)

Here're some of the new features for this season:

- Emblems are now NFT
- Play ranked games with chips (1 Chip = 1 USD)
- New mechanics: cards swap and blueprint purchase are now only available during trading window at the start of a player's turn. We made this change to make it more beginner-friendly, while it won't change the nature of the game's social dynamics.
- Platanium pass holders now get to use Duper stickers in chat
- Duper lootbox: stay tuned for more details!

## ðŸª™ Chips

Chips will be used as the "real-money" currency in Ranked games. 1 Chip = 1 USD.

Chips can be purchased with or sold to ETH, and can be purchased with Sparks as well.

Note: "Gifted Chips" are Chip credits that you may use for Ranked games but may not withdraw to ETH. They do not expire.

## ðŸŽ« Season Pass

Both passes offer real-money rewards, and they provide many other benefits that are essential for players who would like to commit to the season.

Progress towards quests and Ranked game milestones is tracked from the start of the season, regardless of pass ownership. All rewards can be claimed retroactively upon purchasing a pass.

However, it is recommended to purchase a pass early so that you can enjoy the other benefits immediately.

## ðŸ—¿ For new players

By default, new players start with 100 Sparks, and the first 3 casual games are on the house, meaning the loss won't affect their balance.
However, everyone can start earning Sparks immediately if they earn in games.
