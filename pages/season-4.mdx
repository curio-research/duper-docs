# Season IV

Duration: Tuesday, Jan 28, 2025 to Tuesday, April 22, 2025 (12 weeks)

## ðŸª™ Chips

Chips will be used as the "real-money" currency in Ranked games. 1 Chip = 1 USD.

Chips can be purchased with or sold to ETH, and can be purchased with Sparks as well.

Note: "Gifted Chips" are Chip credits that you may use for Ranked games but may not withdraw to ETH. They do not expire.

## ðŸŽ« Season Pass

Both passes offer real-money rewards, and they provide many other benefits that are essential for players who would like to commit to the season.

Progress towards quests and Ranked game milestones is tracked from the start of the season, regardless of pass ownership. All rewards can be claimed retroactively upon purchasing a pass.

However, it is recommended to purchase a pass early so that you can enjoy the other benefits immediately.
