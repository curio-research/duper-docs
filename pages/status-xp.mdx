# Status and XP

The Duper progression system gives honorary avatar frames and unlocks exclusive benefits for Season Pass holders based on their Status.

Note: Status is purely a function of gameplay and Chip balance, and is not tied to performance like typical game ranking systems. Therefore, anyone can get Super Duper status, including you!

## XP Calculation

XP is the basic unit of progression. There is a max 8,000 XP displayed on the progression bar; extra potion still counts but is not displayed. 

There are two ways to earn XP:

### XP from Volume

Volume XP is the sum of all your games' entry fees plus Gold Key purchases. In particular:

- Ranked entry fee: 10 Chip = 10 XP
  - For example, for a Ranked game you played without raising, you earn exactly 10 XP
- Casual entry fee: 1 Chip = 1 XP
- Gold Key purchase: purchase value in USD

Volume XP in Season IV is discounted with a 0.7x multiplier. There is no limit to the number of XP you can earn from volume.

### XP from Chip Balance

Deposit Chips to get the same amount of XP up to 2,500. For example, 1,500 Chips in balance yields 1,500 XP.

XP from this source is live updated with your Chip balance.

## Status Tiers

Each incremental Status requires a particular amount of XP which is updated across seasons, and each unlocks particular benefits given you have a Season Pass of any level. Higher Status tiers keep previous tier benefits.

- 5000+ XP -> Super Duper
  - Unlock: +1 starting gold in Ranked
- 3000+ XP -> Gold
  - Unlock: +1 starting Energy in Ranked
- 1200+ XP -> Silver
  - Unlock: 50% chance to earn Silver Key if net positive but not highest earner in Ranked
- 500+ XP -> Bronze
  - Unlock: 25% chance to earn Silver Key if net positive but not highest earner in Ranked
- 0+ XP -> Iron (no avatar frame in game)

In addition, if you reach 8,000 XP, you will get a one-time Duper Maxi badge as a soulbound NFT.

{/* Introduced in [Season III](/past/season-3), the progression system is designed to make Duper more competitive and rewarding for consistent players. 

### Core Mechanics

Players progress through four main ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Super Duper. Each rank has unique rewards, with XP determining your progress.

| Rank | Casual Games (Loss/Win/Biggest Earner) | Ranked Games (Loss/Win/Biggest Earner) | Required XP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze | 0 / +1 / +2 | 0/ +2 / +4 | 0–15 |
| Silver | -1 / +1 /+2 | -1 / +2 / +4 | 16–40 |
| Gold | -1 / +1 / +1 | -2 / +2 / +3 | 41–65 |
| Super Duper | No XP | -2 / +1 / +2 | 65+ |

The ranks will be expanded and evolved in the future.

### Relative Difficulty Score (RDS)

The RDS (Relative Difficulty Score) works by calculating the average rank value of all players in a game. Each rank has a numerical value:

- Bronze = 1, Silver = 2, Gold = 3, Super Duper = 4

For example, in a game with 3 Bronze players, 1 Gold player, and 1 Super Duper, the RDS would be (1+1+1+4+3) ÷ 5 = 2. This score then determines XP bonuses for lower-ranked players and penalties for higher-ranked players.

Let’s say in that game, a bronze player is the sole winner. They will receie 2 - 1 = 1 XP bonus. The gold player will receive 3 - 2 = 1 XP penalty, and the super duper will receive 4 - 2 = 2 XP penalty.

This ensures fair competition between different ranks.

### Weekly Leaderboard Bonus

- Casual Mode: 1st player will receive a bonus of 3XP, 2nd player will receive a bonus of 2XP, and 3rd player will receive a bonus of 1XP
- Ranked Mode: 1st player will receive a bonus of 6XP, 2nd player will receive a bonus of 4XP, 3rd player will receive a bonus of 3XP. 4th - 6th players will receive a bonus of 2XP. 7th - 10th players will receive a bonus of 1XP.
