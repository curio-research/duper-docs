## üêµ For New Players

If you're new to Duper, welcome! Check out [Quick Start](.) for an overview of the game.

You start with 3 1-Chip vouchers (worth \$3 USD total) which expire at the end of the season. Pass Playground and play 3 Casual games to earn 3 more 1-Chip vouchers for free. Then consider getting a Season Pass to dive in.

If you've played fewer than 3 games in Season IV, you'll also get 3 1-Chip vouchers as a return bonus.

## üé´ Season V Pass

A Season Pass unlocks most features and rewards for the season. Great for getting the full experience.

- Gold Pass: cost \$15, receive up to \$92.5 worth of direct reward items plus other benefits
- Platinum Pass: costs \$80, receive up to \$248 worth of direct reward items plus other benefits

Pass holders unlock

- Instant full cashback in the form of Chip vouchers, worth \$15 and \$80 respectively. These vouchers expire after 1 month instead of 7 days, which is the default.
- Milestone rewards from gameplay points, including Gold Keys, Chip vouchers, Emblems, and Sparks (more for Platinum)
- Raffle rewards for every 2-loss streak in Ranked/Casual
- In-game chat stickers (Platinum only)
- Quests
- Daily claims

You can upgrade from Gold to Platinum for \$65 at any time and receive 9 5-Chip vouchers and 10 2-Chip vouchers instantly. However, you cannot claim Platinum milestone rewards retroactively, so it's best to do so early.

## ü•£ Duper Bowl

The [Duper Bowl](/tournaments#duper-bowl), the biggest tournament in Duper, is back after the end of Season V.

The prize pool starts at \$3,000, put up by Duper team, and will increase as more players start contributing to their Duper Bowl balances. Every competitor will have a chance to win a share of the prize pool.

More details on the Duper Bowl rules will be released in mid-season.

### How to Participate

Competitor requirements:

1. Hold a Season Pass
2. Reach at least [Bronze Status](/status-xp) by the start of the Duper Bowl
3. Fill your Duper Bowl balance to \$160

Two ways to fill your Duper Bowl balance:

- Approach 1: Contribute \$100 from gameplay during season
  - Toggle ‚ÄúContribute‚Äù on while playing Ranked or Casual games to deposit 50% of your *net earning* in each game towards your Duper Bowl balance (no contribution if you lose). This is available from the beginning of the season, and you can toggle this on or off at any time. Contribution automatically switches off once you've contributed \$100, and Duper team matches \$60 to your Duper Bowl balance after.
  - If you've contributed between \$20 and \$100 to your Duper Bowl balance and decide to withdraw, you can do so any time with a 20% fee. You can restart contributing anytime.
- Approach 2: Top up \$160 directly using regular Chips
