# Quick Start

Duper is a wagering social war game. Set on a faraway desert planet, 5 players build up their armory, compete to take over territories, forge alliances, and backstab each other to earn money. A game session typically lasts 30-45 minutes. You can play for free or with real money stakes.

### What makes Duper unique?

Imagine a game where you strategize like TFT, battle like Starcraft, trade like Catan, conspire like Diplomacy, and wager like Poker. That's Duper in a nutshell, and people love it. Try yourself to feel the magic.

### When can I play?

- **Ranked (0.005 ETH buy-in)**: 3+ windows hosted per week. Stay tuned on the game website.
- **Casual**: Open a few hours per day. Specific time may vary — check game website.
- **Custom**: Open 24/7. Play with friends and/or AIs.

More game times are coming soon. Learn more about the game modes [here](modes).

### How do I get started?

Create an account on the [game website](https://www.duper.gg). Try the Playground mode and try to beat the AI. Don't be frustrated if you fail in the first try—many do. Check out the "How to Pass Playground" video on our YouTube if needed.

Then, play some Casual games to practice your skills and observe how the diplomacy plays out. When you're ready, transfer some Arbitrum ETH into your Privy wallet and deposit it into the game contract to play a Ranked game. Fetch a season pass for more exclusive rewards.

Two most helpful resources besides playing based on our community: videos on our [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@dupergame) and game rules in the [Wiki](./wiki/) up next.

### What are the game elements?

There’s a strategy game component (produce troops and buildings, expand territory, and fight) and a diplomacy game component (chatting and trading).

There’re 3 important resource types in Duper:

1. Gold: get from capitals, level-3 tiles, economy research centers, and trades; use for production.
2. Card: get from roundly yields, taking level-2 or level-3 NPC tiles, capital upgrades, and trades; use for advanced production.
3. Gem (think of them as stocks or equity of a player): initiated for each player at game start and also if/when a player raises (add more stake); settles game payout.

Out of all resources, gems are the most important and often the hardest to fully understand, but once you do, you can call yourself a real duper.

### How do I win?

Own 12 tiles or hold a 5-card _straight flush_ (see [Cards](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#cards) section) for one round to win and end a game.

### How do I earn?

Hold lots of the eventual winner's gems. But wait—it's not so simple.

Winning and earning are two different concepts in Duper, and winning is just one way to earn. After someone wins, the pot is divided as follows:

1. The winner takes out their total stake from the pot. As a result, the winner is guaranteed not to lose money.
2. The remaining pot is divided in proportion to how many winner-minted gems each player owns.

To maximize your ownership of the eventual winner's gems, either win yourself through meeting one of the [Victory Conditions](./wiki/flow/victory.mdx), or make a judgment on which player(s) are most likely to win and solicit plenty of their gems through trading.

### I don't have ETH on Arbitrum yet. How do I play?

Start with Playground, Casual, or Custom mode—all three can be played for free.

To play Ranked mode or buy a season pass, go to duper.gg/wallet to find your Duper wallet address. Buy ETH with fiat money on exchanges such as [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/price/ethereum). Send some ETH (recommended ~0.015 to start) **<u>on Arbitrum network</u>** to your Duper address. Finally, deposit the ETH into the game inventory to play Ranked, or leave them in your wallet to purchase season passes or other items in the store.
