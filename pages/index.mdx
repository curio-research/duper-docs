# Quick Start

Duper is a wagering social war game. Set on a faraway desert planet, 5 players build up their armory, compete to take over territories, forge alliances, and backstab each other to earn money. A game session typically lasts 30-45 minutes. You can play for free or with real money stakes.

### What makes Duper unique?

Duper is where Poker meets Risk with a twist of Diplomacy.

Duper takes in-game diplomacy to a level unseen in any game — secret alliances from resource exchanges, steaming conspiracies, and outright backstabbing are not only allowed, but encouraged. This gives rise to infinite social speculation and replayability, which is especially important in a game natively involving stakes.

### How do I get started?

Create an account on the [game website](https://www.duper.gg). Try the Playground mode and try to beat the AI. Don't be frustrated if you fail in the first few attempts — many people do.

Then, play some Casual games to practice your skills and observe how the social diplomacy plays out. When you're ready, transfer some Arbitrum ETH into your Privy wallet and deposit it into the game contract to play a Ranked game.

### What are the game elements?

There’s a strategy game component (produce troops and buildings, expand territory, and fight) and a diplomacy game component (chatting and trading).

There’re 3 important resource types in Duper:

1. Gold: generated from capitals, level-3 tiles, and economists; used for production.
2. Card: given at beginning of rounds to each player; used for advanced production.
3. Gem (like equity): minted by each player at game start and also if/when a player raises (add more stake); used to settle game payout.

### How do I win?

A game ends when a player either owns 12 tiles or collects a 5-card _straight flush_ (for what this means, see the [Resources](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#cards) page). That player is referred to as the "winner".

### How do I earn?

In short, hold lots of the eventual winner's gems.

Winning and earning are two different concepts in Duper, and winning is just one way to earn. After someone wins, the pot is divided as follows:

1. The winner takes out their total stake from the pot. As a result, the winner is guaranteed not to lose money.
2. The remaining pot is divided in proportion to how many winner-minted gems each player owns.

To maximize your gem ownership of the eventual winner's gems, either win yourself through meeting one of the Victory Conditions, or make a judgment on which player(s) are most likely to win and solicit plenty of their gems through trading.

### I don't have ETH on Arbitrum yet. How do I play?

You can start with Playground, Casual mode, and Custom mode, which can all be played for free.

To play Ranked mode, go to duper.gg/wallet to find your Duper wallet address. Buy ETH with fiat money on exchanges such as [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/price/ethereum). Send some ETH (recommended ~0.015 to start) **<u>on Arbitrum network</u>** to your Duper address. Finally, deposit the ETH into the game inventory.
