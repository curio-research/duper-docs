### What is Duper?

Duper is a 5-player free-for-all social war game with real money prizes. Imagine a game where you strategize like TFT, trade like Catan, deceive like Among Us, and play cards like Poker—that's Duper in a nutshell, and people love it. A game session typically lasts 15-25 minutes. There's a free-to-play mode, but the real fun comes with real money entry fees and prizes.

### How do I get started?

Create an account on [duper.gg](https://www.duper.gg). Play the Playground and try to beat the AI. Don't be frustrated if you fail in the first try—many do. Check out the "How to Pass Playground" video on our YouTube if needed.

Then, play some Casual games before going into Ranked. Pay particular attention to diplomacy and the role of [gems](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#gems), the most critical resource in Duper. Buy a season pass to enjoy the fullest benefits of any season.

Playing is by far the best way to learn. In addition, two helpful resources recommended by our community: [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@dupergame) video guides, and game rules in the [Wiki](./wiki/) up next.

### How do I win?

To win, own a certain number of tiles shown on the Objective panel, or hold a _5-card straight flush_ (see [Cards](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#cards) section) for one round.

### How do I earn?

Winning and earning are two different concepts in Duper, and winning is just one way to earn. After someone wins, the prize pool is divided as follows:

1. The winner first takes out an amount worth their entry fee from the pool. As a result, the winner is guaranteed not to lose money.
2. The remaining pool is divided in proportion to how many winner-minted gems each player owns.

To maximize your ownership of the eventual winner's gems, either win yourself through meeting one of the [Victory Conditions](./wiki/flow/victory.mdx), or judge which player(s) are most likely to win and solicit for their gems through diplomacy.
