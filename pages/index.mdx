# Quick Start

Welcome! This is the only page you need before playing your first Duper game. Even though Duper has a lot of strategic depth, you can start playing with just a few key concepts. For detailed rules, proceed to the [Game Wiki](./wiki).

### What is Duper?

Duper is a wagering social war game. Set on a faraway desert planet, 5 players build up their armory, compete to take over territories, forge alliances, and backstab each other to earn money. A game session typically lasts 30-45 minutes. You can play for free or with real money stakes.

### What makes Duper unique?

For lack of better comparison: Duper is where Poker meets Risk, but with a twist of Diplomacy.

Duper takes in-game diplomacy to a level unseen in any game — secret alliances from resource exchanges, steaming conspiracies, and outright backstabbing are not only allowed, but encouraged, in Duper. This gives rise to infinite social speculation and replayability, which is especially important in a game natively involving stakes.

### When can I play?

- **Ranked (0.005 ETH buy-in)**: Open Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday 11am-2pm Pacific Time (6-9pm UTC).
- **Casual**: Open every day 9am-12pm Pacific Time (4-7pm UTC) and 6-9pm Pacific Time (1-4am UTC).
- **Custom**: Open 24/7.
- **Playground**: Open 24/7.

More dates and times will be opened when there are more players. Learn more about the game modes [here](modes).

### How do I get started?

Here's a 15-minute tutorial on the basic game actions and things to strategize on:

After you read this page and watch the tutorial, go on the [game website](https://www.duper.gg), create an account, and try the Playground mode. Explore the actions first, then try to beat the AI. Don't be frustrated if you fail in the first few attempts — most people do.

After you've beaten the AI, play some Casual games to practice your skills and observe how the social diplomacy plays out. When you're ready, transfer some Arbitrum ETH into your Privy wallet and deposit it into the game contract to play a Ranked game.

### What are the game elements?

There’s a strategy game component (produce troops and buildings, expand territory, and fight) and a diplomacy game component (chatting and trading).

There’re 3 important resource types in Duper:

1. Gold: generated from capitals, level-3 tiles, and economists; used for production.
2. Card: given at beginning of rounds to each player; used for advanced production.
3. Gem (like equity): minted by each player at game start and also if/when a player raises (add more stake); used to settle game payout.

### How do I win?

A game ends when a player either owns 12 tiles or collects a 5-card _straight flush_ (for what this means, see the [Resources](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#cards) page). That player is referred to as the "winner".

### How do I earn?

In short, hold lots of the eventual winner's gems.

Winning and earning are two different concepts in Duper: Winning is just one way to earn. After someone wins, the pot is divided as follows:

1. The winner takes out their total stake from the pot. As a result, the winner is guaranteed not to lose money.
2. The remaining pot is divided in proportion to how many winner-minted gems each player owns.

To maximize your gem ownership of the eventual winner's gems, either win yourself through meeting one of the Victory Conditions, or make a judgment on which player(s) are most likely to win and solicit plenty of their gems through trading.

### Any other tips for a new player?

1. Prioritize conquering barbarian tiles over player tiles, because you don’t get rewards conquering player tiles.
2. Mark your cards for sale so other players may trade cards with you. This is the most straightforward way you get their gems.
3. Form soft alliances with another player through owning each other’s minted gems.

### I don't have Ethereum yet. How do I play?

You can start with Playground, Casual mode, and Custom mode, which can all be played for free.

To play Ranked mode with Ethereum, first buy some Ethereum (recommended ~0.015 to start) using a centralized exchange such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/ethereum). Then, change your Ethereum network to Arbitrum and transfer the Ethereum to your Duper wallet. You can find your wallet address by clicking on your wallet on the top right of the game website. Lastly, deposit the Ethereum into the game inventory.
