# Quick Start

New to Duper? You're in the right place! Let's get you up to speed in no time.

### What is Duper?

Duper is a 5-player free-for-all game where strategy meets deception and real money prizes. Think chess/TFT's strategy, Catan's trading, Among Us's deception, and Poker's card play—all rolled into one exciting 15-30 minute session. While there's a free-to-play mode, the real thrill comes with real money stakes.

### How do I win?

Two paths to victory:
- Own the required number of tiles (shown on Objective panel)
- Hold a _5-card straight flush_ for one round (see [Cards](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#cards))

### How do I earn?

Here's the fun part! Winning and earning are different in Duper, and winning is just one way to score. After someone wins:

1. Winner gets their entry fee back (you never lose money when you win!)
2. Remaining prize pool is split based on winner-minted gems each player owns

Pro tip: Either win yourself or befriend the likely winner to get their gems through diplomacy.
