New to Duper? You're in the right place! Let's get you up to speed in no time.

### What is Duper?

Duper is a 5-player free-for-all game where strategy meets deception and real money prizes. Think chess/TFT's strategy, Catan's trading, Among Us's deception, and Poker's card play—all rolled into one exciting 20 minute session.

### What are the game modes?

- **Ranked (\$2 entry)**: The main event!
- **Casual (\$0.1 entry)**: Perfect for practice and fun.
- **Practice (free, non-PvP)**: You vs. 4 AI bots.
- **Custom (\$2+ entry)**: Play with friends and AI bots. Great for private parties.
- **Tutorial**: Start here if you're new.
- **League (\$10+ entry)**: Weekly higher-stake tournament. Where legends are made.
