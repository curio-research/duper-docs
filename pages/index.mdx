# Quick Start

First time hearing about Duper? This page will get you up to speed in no time.

### What is Duper?

Duper is a social war game with native stakes. Imagine a game where you strategize like TFT, battle like Starcraft, trade like Catan, conspire like Diplomacy, and wager like Poker—that's Duper in a nutshell, and people love it. A game session typically lasts 25-40 minutes. There's a free-to-play mode, but the real fun comes with real money stakes.

### When can I play?

- **Ranked (0.005 ETH buy-in)**: 3+ windows hosted per week. Stay tuned on the game website.
- **Casual (100 Sparks buy-in)**: Open a few hours per day. Specific time may vary — check game website.
- **Custom**: Open 24/7. Play with friends and/or AIs.
- **Playground**: Open 24/7. Start here if you're new.

More game windows are coming soon. Learn more about the game modes [here](modes).

### How do I get started?

Create an account on the [game website](https://www.duper.gg). Play the Playground and try to beat the AI. Don't be frustrated if you fail in the first try—many do. Check out the "How to Pass Playground" video on our YouTube if needed.

Then, play some Casual games. Pay particular attention to diplomacy and the role of [gems](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#gems), the most critical resource in Duper. When you're ready, transfer some Arbitrum ETH into your Privy wallet and deposit it into the game contract to play a Ranked game. Buy a season pass for a variety of rewards.

Two most helpful resources recommended by our community: [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@dupergame) video guides, and game rules in the [Wiki](./wiki/) up next. That said, playing is still by far the best way to learn.

### How do I win?

Own 12 tiles or hold a 5-card _straight flush_ (see [Cards](./wiki/fundamentals/resources#cards) section) for one round to win and end a game.

### How do I earn?

Hold lots of the eventual winner's gems. But wait—it's not so simple.

Winning and earning are two different concepts in Duper, and winning is just one way to earn. After someone wins, the pot is divided as follows:

1. The winner takes out their total stake from the pot. As a result, the winner is guaranteed not to lose money.
2. The remaining pot is divided in proportion to how many winner-minted gems each player owns.

To maximize your ownership of the eventual winner's gems, either win yourself through meeting one of the [Victory Conditions](./wiki/flow/victory.mdx), or make a judgment on which player(s) are most likely to win and solicit plenty of their gems through trading.

### I don't have ETH on Arbitrum yet. How do I play?

Start with Playground, Casual, or Custom mode—all three can be played for free.

To play Ranked mode or buy a season pass, go to duper.gg/wallet to find your Duper wallet address. Buy ETH with fiat money on exchanges such as [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/price/ethereum). Send some ETH (recommended ~0.015 to start) **<u>on Arbitrum network</u>** to your Duper address. Finally, deposit the ETH into the game inventory to play Ranked, or leave them in your wallet to purchase season passes or other items in the store.
