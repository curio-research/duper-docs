# "Super Duper Host" Referral Program

Starting in [Season I](/season-1), the "Super Duper Host" referral program is in effect. The referral program is standalone from seasons and will evolve separately from them, including Season I.

The TLDR: **<u>Refer high-quality players to Duper to earn ETH and Sparks.</u>**

## How does it work?

For referrers:

- Each player has 1 unique referral code, unlimited use. Find your referral code in your Profile page of the game website.
- Each referral gives rewards for 2 months based on your referee's gameplay, especially Ranked mode.

For new players:

- You do NOT need a referral to start playing Duper. Go to the [game website](https://www.duper.gg) and start playing.
- If someone helps you a lot while learning Duper, whether directly via teaching or indirectly via content, you have the option to mark them as your referrer in order to support them. You can do so in your Profile page.
- You can also start referring people immediately.

## How do I earn more as a referrer?

1. Send your referral link to people you think would enjoy Duper.
2. Help your referees learn Duper so they can play well in Ranked and Casual games. This may include pointing them to helpful resources and teaching them how to play in Custom mode.
3. Encourage your referees to play more games, especially Ranked mode.
4. Help new players learn Duper and encourage them to add/update you as their referrer. This may include creating helpful videos, streaming, hosting weekly game walkthroughs, etc.
5. Pay attention to the 7-day referral leaderboard. There are additional rewards for the biggest referrers in Duper.
