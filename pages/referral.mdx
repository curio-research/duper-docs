# Referral Program

Starting in [Season I](/season-1), the Duper Referral Program is in effect, and won't be affected by upcoming seasons.

## How does it work?

- Each player has 1 unique referral code, unlimited use..
- Each successful referral gives ETH and Sparks rewards for 2 months based on their gameplay, especially in real-money modes.
- The top referrers each season gets a "Super Duper Host" badge of honor, which comes with privileges in the Duper ecosystem.

## The TLDR

Duper is still very early. As the Duper team, we believe the game has huge potential to become the go-to wagering game, but the only way it'll get there is with your help. Therefore, we're excited to explore lots of ways in which we can reward you, our earliest supporters, for helping grow the ecosystem.

We've designed the referral program to reward not just quantity, but very much quality of referral. Inviting 3 people who play actively, buy the season pass, and get on the Ranked leaderboard will get you more rewards than inviting 30 who don't end up playing much.

## How do I earn more as a referrer?

1. Send your referral link to friends you think would enjoy Duper.
2. Help more people discover and start playing Duper, for example by creating helpful text and video content.
3. Help players you refer learn Duper and play well, for example by pointing them to helpful resources and teaching them how to play in Custom mode.
4. Encourage players you refer to play more games, especially Ranked mode.
5. Pay attention to the 7-day referral leaderboard. There are additional rewards for the biggest referrers in Duper.

That being said, feel free to be creative in bringing people to Duper. It may be one of the above ways, or it may be something innovative which the referral program doesn't currently account for. If that is the case, we will retroactively update the program and make sure you are supported and rewarded.
