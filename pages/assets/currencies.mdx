# Currencies

Chips and Sparks are the two primary currencies in the Duper ecosystem.

### Chips

Chips are a real-money currency that is 1:1 in value with USD. They are used for entering games and winning prizes. Chips can be deposited or withdrawn any time. Note that there is a 7-day review period for all withdrawals to prevent cheating and fraud.

Chip vouchers can be used as Chips in real-money modes.
- Each Chip voucher can only be used in a game mode with entry fee at least its value. For example, you cannot use 5-Chip or 10-Chip vouchers in Casual games, where the starting entry fee is 2 Chips.
- Up to 2 vouchers can be used per day.
- Chip vouchers by default expire after 1 week unless otherwise specified (such as those given upon Season Pass purchase).

### Sparks

Sparks are a typical in-game currency, used for buying items such as [Gold Keys](./lootboxes#how-to-open-a-lootbox) and trading up [Emblems](./emblems#emblem-merging-trade-up). They can be purchased directly from the store and earned from quests and limited-time events.
