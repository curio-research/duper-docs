# Sparks

Sparks are the primary Duper stable currency alongside ETH and Chips.

Sparks serve as the unit for entry fees and prize payouts in Casual games. They can be earned via achieving quests and earning in Casual games. They can also be purchased from the store.

Sparks can be cashed out to Chip vouchers for no fees, or to ETH with a small fee.
