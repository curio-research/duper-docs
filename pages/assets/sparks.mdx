# Sparks

Sparks are the primary Duper ecosystem currency alongside ETH.

Sparks serve as unit for both entry fees and prize payouts in Casual games. They can be earned via achieving quests and earning in Casual games. They can also be purchased from the store.

Sparks can also be used for a variety of purchases in the store, such as chips, at a slight discount. They can also be used to activate newly purchased emblems or cash out from the store directly. More utilities will be revealed in future seasons.

Note that your Sparks balance only starts to count after you have purchased the Level 1 Season Pass for at least one season. If that's not the case, you cannot earn or lose Sparks in games, and you can only play Casual games for 2 weeks.
