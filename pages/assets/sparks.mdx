# Sparks

Sparks are the primary Duper ecosystem currency alongside ETH.

Sparks serve as unit for both entry fees and prize payouts in Casual games. They can be earned via achieving quests and earning in Casual games. They can also be purchased from the store.

Sparks have various utilities in the Duper ecosystem. They can be used to upgrade lootboxes so to yield rarer [emblems](./emblems). They can also be used for a variety of purchases in the store, such as Ranked vouchers, at a slight discount. Lastly, starting in [Season II](./season-2.mdx), they can be sold directly back to the store. More utilities will be revealed in future seasons.

Note that your Sparks balance only starts to count after you have purchased the Level 1 Season Pass for at least one season. If that's not the case, you cannot earn or lose Sparks in games, and you can only play Casual games for 2 weeks.
