# Emblems

## NFT
Emblems will be NFT starting from season IV. Gensis lootbox holders will be able to claim free emblems, and genesis ace holders will get emblems airdrop.  

We're revealing four kinds of emblems for players to use in season IV (see below). Two of them are commander focus, one is card-master focus, and one is magician focus.

Three more mysterious emblems (one for each focus) will be revealed after season IV, although they will start to be tradable along with the other emblems at the start of the season.

If you purchase an emblem from secondary market, you'll need to pay some sparks to activate it based on its rarity.
- Common: 100 sparks
- Uncommon: 200 sparks
- Rare: 400 sparks
- Legendary: 800 sparks

## Mechanics
Emblems offer exciting ways for players to increase their entry fee and risk. Depending on different scenarios and strategies, players can use emblems to put up extra entry fees and receive random effects during the game.

The emblem system will add many interesting elements to the game's risk dynamics. The game will remain fair for players who prefer not to put up extra entry fees, as none of the special effects from emblems can directly determine the game outcome. Emblem users bear additional risk for these effects.

We're introducing four types of emblems (seven different ones considering rarity) for testing in season II. All emblems will be available to you if you have a season II pass.
