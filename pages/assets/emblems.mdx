# Emblems

Emblems are the first tradable utility assets in Duper. There are 4 tiers of Emblems: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary. You can use Emblems in game sessions to gain advantage by taking additional risk.

The specific Emblems and their utility will be announced at the end of Season I.
