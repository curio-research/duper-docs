# Emblems

Emblems offer exciting ways for players to increase their entry fee and risk. Depending on different scenarios and strategies, players can use emblems to put up extra entry fees and receive random effects during the game.

The emblem system will add many interesting elements to the game's risk dynamics. The game will remain fair for players who prefer not to put up extra entry fees, as none of the special effects from emblems can directly determine the game outcome. Emblem users bear additional risk for these effects.

We're introducing four types of emblems (seven different ones considering rarity) for testing in season II. All emblems will be available to you if you have a season II pass.
