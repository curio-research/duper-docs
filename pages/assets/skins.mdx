# Skins

Duper has skins and cosmetics for players who wish to enjoy the game in a more upgraded and personalized way.

The first and only skin in Duper as of Season IV and V is the Duper Pudgy skin. It is a soldier skin which you can choose whether or not to equip for each game. It can be opened from Lootboxes, and is also tradeable on secondary markets with this [smart contract address](https://magiceden.io/collections/abstract/0x2b5c37bcd0c9fbeeee8287401e1a5e74a300ff72). Be cautious of scams when trading on secondary markets.
