# Lootboxes and Keys

Lootboxes are live starting in Season IV! Get Emblems, skins, and other rare items you'd like by acquiring Keys to open Lootboxes.

### What's inside a Lootbox?

Each Lootbox opens to exactly 1 item. Below are all the possible items from a Lootbox:

- 5 levels of [Emblems](emblems) ordered by increasing rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, and Limited Edition, as well as 3 Unrevealed Emblem classes. The Limited Edition Emblems and Unrevealed Emblems are tradable; the rest are bound to the account.
  - Up to 50 Limited Edition Emblems for each of the 4 classes can be opened from Lootboxes, on a first-come, first-served basis
  - Up to 100 Unrevealed Emblems for each of the 3 classes can be opened from Lootboxes, also on a FCFS basis
