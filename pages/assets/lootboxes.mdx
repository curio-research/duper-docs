# Lootboxes and Keys

Lootboxes are live starting in [Season IV](../season-4)! Get Emblems, skins, and other rare items you'd like by acquiring Keys to open Lootboxes.

### What's inside a Lootbox?

Each Lootbox opens to exactly 1 item. Below are all the possible items from a Lootbox:

- 5 levels of [Emblems](emblems) ordered by increasing rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, and Limited Edition, as well as 3 Unrevealed Emblem classes. The Limited Edition Emblems and Unrevealed Emblems are tradable NFTs; the rest are soulbound.
  - Up to 50 Limited Edition Emblems for each of the 4 classes can be opened from Lootboxes, on a first-come, first-served basis
  - Up to 100 Unrevealed Emblems for each of the 3 classes can be opened from Lootboxes, also on a FCFS basis
- Ranked vouchers bundle, each worth between \$5 and \$15
- 30 Genesis Ace NFTs on a FCFS basis (transferred to you manually by team shortly after if opened)
