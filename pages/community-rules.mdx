# Community Rules

As the Duper team, we strive to provide a secure, fair and friendly playing environment for all of our players. In order to uphold these strict principles and the integrity of our games, Duper has created these Community Rules below.

### Rules for all game modes

1. You may not play with multiple accounts.
2. You may not abuse the in-game chat with spam, harmful, or explicit content.
3. You may not ask others about their contact information.

### Rules for public game modes (i.e. Ranked and Casual)

1. Preteaming is strictly forbidden. While in a game, you must limit your communication to the in-game chat. Outside the in-game chat, you may not coordinate in-game actions with others for the sake of gaining advantage. Generally, you should only share in-game information after a game ends. If you wish to talk to or coordinate with others externally during a game, for example when playing with friends, go to Custom mode.
   - Note: Streaming games voluntarily and not for the sake of gaining advantage _is_ allowed. However, do so with caution especially in high-entry games, as there is a low but nonzero chance a player in the same game watches your stream and learns, against your interest, information otherwise hidden to them.
2. Payouts must not be settled outside of game. Received payouts for a game by a player must reflect the gem distribution at the end of the game. This is to prevent self-sacrificial schemes to help a particular player win, which would be unfair to the other players.

Violations of the above rules may result in warning, reward slashing, or account suspension when detected, depending on the severity and intent of the violations.

If you encounter or suspect someone for violating the above rules, you may report them in game or in Duperâ€™s Discord server by opening a support ticket and providing the necessary text explanation and screenshot. Responsible reporting will be rewarded, while spamming reporting may result in punishment similar to rule violation.

Hopefully these rules are self-evident. If you have questions about them, feel free to ask in Discord as well. In general, act in good faith, and have fun!
