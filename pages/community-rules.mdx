# Community Rules

As the Duper team, we strive to provide a secure, fair and friendly playing environment for all of our players. In order to uphold these strict principles and the integrity of our games, Duper has created these Community Rules below.

### Rules for all game modes

1. You may not play with multiple accounts.
2. You may not abuse the in-game chat with spam, harmful, or explicit content.
3. You may not ask others about their contact information in game.

### Rules for public game modes (i.e. Ranked and Casual)

1. Preteaming is strictly forbidden. While in a game, you must limit your communication to the in-game chat. Outside the in-game chat, you may not coordinate in-game actions with others for the sake of gaining advantage. Generally, you should only share in-game information after a game ends. If you wish to talk to or coordinate with others externally during a game, for example when playing with friends, go to Custom mode.
   - Note: Streaming games voluntarily and not for the sake of gaining advantage _is_ allowed. However, do so with caution especially in high-entry games, as there is a low but nonzero chance a player in the same game watches your stream and learns, against your interest, information otherwise hidden to them.
2. Payouts must not be settled outside of game. Received payouts for a game by a player must reflect the gem distribution at the end of the game. This is to prevent self-sacrificial schemes to help a particular player win, which would be unfair to the other players.

Violations of the above rules may result in reward slashing or account suspension when detected, depending on the severity of the violations.

If you encounter or suspect someone for violating the above rules, you may report them in game or in Duper’s Discord server by opening a support ticket and providing the necessary text explanation and screenshot. Responsible reporting will be rewarded, while spamming reporting may result in punishment similar to rule violation.

Hopefully these rules are self-evident. If you have questions about them, feel free to ask in Discord as well. In general, act in good faith, and have fun!

### FAQ

***Q: Sometimes I feel like I’m waiting for a long time in Ranked queue and ask my friends to queue up as well, and we end up in the same game. Is this considered preteaming?***

The act of rallying your friends to queue up alone is not considered preteaming. However, we don’t recommend it because it increases your chance of being reported by other players, and is also generally unnecessary because Ranked matchmaking time rarely exceeds 15 minutes during the current game windows. If your goal is to play with your friends, consider playing Custom mode—you can even play for real money there.

If you insist on rallying your friends in Ranked and Casual modes, make sure you read the above Community Rules extra carefully.

***Q: I only talk in my native language in game, and feel a natural affinity towards my countrymen when making alliances. Is this considered preteaming?***

Generally not, but we would encourage you to focus on your own interest and treat other players as equally as you can. Broadening your potential allies can actually boost your earn rate! We are also improving the translation feature so communication will feel more seamless soon.

***Q: I notice a few pro players often end up in the same games. Are they preteaming?***

There can be many reasons why two people end up in many games together, such as game window preference, number of games played, etc, so just that fact alone does not constitute preteaming. But there may be other factors that suggest otherwise on a case by case basis.

***Q: What’s Duper’s policy on Community Rule violations?***

There are currently 4 potential punishments for Community Rules violation:
1. 3-day suspension: For players who AFK in multiple games.
2. Warning ban: For players who have low- to moderate-severity violations. This is to let violators realize their violation so to avoid doing so in the future.
3. Fund slashing: Often together as warning ban. Restricted to funds acquired via preteaming or other disallowed behaviors.
4. Ban: For players who have high-severity violations.

We take a variety of factors, most importantly game replays, into account when validating violations, and generally they are pretty accurate. Except for AFK, we don’t disclose specific evidence of rule violations, because that would allow cheaters to upgrade their tactics (which has happened before when we did give evidence). If you violated Community Rules, regardless of your intention, genuine self-reflection and apology can potentially earn you an unban, while threats and spreading misinformation will get you nowhere.

***Q: I lost funds to cheaters in a game. Do I get reimbursed if I report them and their cheating is validated?***

Yes! Community Rules exist in the first place to create a fair environment for our players. Please open a ticket and we’ll help you there.
