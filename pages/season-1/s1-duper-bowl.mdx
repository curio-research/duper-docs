- Elimination
  - When a competitor is eliminated, their remaining balance rolls _pro rata_ to the final match prize pool.
  - There are two ways a competitor may be eliminated:
    1. The competitor has a lower balance than the minimum ante for the next game.
    2. The competitor has missed a greater number of games than allowed for in a particular stage.
- Early exit
  - At the beginning of each break before the balance bonus is distributed, each competitor has an opportunity to exit the tournament. Leaving early is discouraged, but the option offers competitors flexibility to take home the profit, stop loss, or discontinue on the tournament for whatever other reason.
  - Early exit penalty: 20% of balance. Rolls _pro rata_ to final match prize pool.
- Top up
  - At any point before being eliminated, a competitor has an opportunity to top up more ETH directly into their balance.
  - Each competitor can top up only once in the entire tournament.

## Additional Specs

- Tournament referral
  - Competitors who has purchased a ticket for \$300 can invite up to 2 people to participate (if you need more, let us know!). Eligible invitees are limited to people who have played fewer than 2 casual and ranked games in total before Season I.
    - Rationale: This is a separate and more targeted referral program than the [Duper Referral Program](../referral). It is intended to encourage Duper veterans to scout out one or two friends who are most likely to enjoy Duper, and to speed-prep them for the Duper Bowl.
  - The invitee gets 15\% discount on their entry ticket. If the invitee wins one of the 3 final match prizes, the inviter gets an additional 30% of the prize won from the Duper team as sign of gratitude.
- Suggested participation structure for guilds
  - Guilds may decide to scout and sponsor entry tickets for their Duper players in return for a cut of their total profit from the tournament.
- Replays of every game in the tournament are made available to watch immediately after it ends.
- A few competitors will stream their games live throughout the tournament. If you're interested to do this, let us know!
