# S1 Duper Bowl

The Duper Bowl is Duper's flagship official tournament series.

The first Duper Bowl takes place at the end of Season I. It is a 6-day tournament with 2 stages and 1 final match. \$10,000+ USD total prize pool for all participants.

## Prize Structure

- Total prize pool: \$10,000+
  - \~\$8,000 on the Duper team on final match prize pool, discounts, and stage bonuses
  - The rest from entry tickets
- Final match prize pool
  - Top earner: \$2,000
  - Second earner: \$1,200
  - Winner: \$800
  - Note that this final match prize pool increases from eliminations and early exits.
  - Final match competitors take home their balance in addition to the prize after the final match.
  - 600 Sparks are rewarded for each competitor.
- Balance bonuses
  - 0.01 ETH is added to each competitor's balance for those who make it to Break I and Break II and do not exit early.

So how do you make money? The TLDR: Compete and stay in the tournament for as long as possible by leveling up your gameplay skills, for example via lots of Ranked games. If you love risk, top up more ETH to increase your chance for getting into the final match with huge positive EV. If you'd like more safety, play well and exit early to take home the profit.

## Main Specs

- Entry
  - Ticket: 0.03 ETH (\~\$75)
    - 33\% discount if competitor has a Season I Pass or has played 10+ games in Season I
  - At the start of tournament, each competitor starts with the 0.03 ETH in their tournament balance.
- Basic rules
  - Total duration: 6 days
  - 2 games per day for every competitor, one at 7am PT, one at 8:30am PT, except break days.
  - Competitors must join each scheduled game window within 10 minutes from the start time; otherwise, it counts as a miss.
  - Matchmaking is predetermined by Duper team to match each competitor with as many opponents as possible. Specific matching is hidden until all games have started in each game window to prevent collusion.
  - Both pre-game bids and in-game raises are no limit, i.e. limited only by the competitor's balance.
  - Fairness for all is a top priority for the tournament. All [Community Rules](../community-rules) are in effect, and competitors are encouraged to report violations as soon as suspected. Violations of community rules, if validated by the Duper team, will result in immediate disqualification and forfeiture of balance.
- Elimination
  - When a competitor is eliminated, their remaining balance rolls _pro rata_ to the final match prize pool.
  - There are two ways a competitor may be eliminated:
    1. The competitor has a lower balance than the minimum ante for the next game.
    2. The competitor has missed a greater number of games than allowed for in a particular stage.
- Early exit
  - At the beginning of each break before the balance bonus is distributed, each competitor has an opportunity to exit the tournament. Leaving early is discouraged, but the option offers competitors flexibility to take home the profit, stop loss, or discontinue on the tournament for whatever other reason.
  - Early exit penalty: 10% of balance. Rolls _pro rata_ to final match prize pool.
- Top up
  - At any point before being eliminated, a competitor has an opportunity to top up more ETH directly into their balance.
  - Each competitor can top up only once in the entire tournament.
  - Top up amount: minimum 0.01 ETH, maximum 0.05 ETH.
