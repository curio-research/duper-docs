# S1 Duper Bowl Betting

Anyone can bet on Duper Bowl participants for each stage using sparks. Wagers must be placed before each stage starts, and prizes will be distributed at the end of each stage.

We award winning wagers a 1.3X bonus for every stage, making it +EV to participate in betting.

In addition, Duper gives players in the betting pool an additional 20% of wagers placed on them. This part of the reward
is capped at 1000 sparks and fully unlocked if the player wins or survives.

## Stage I - II Betting

In stages I - II, players who have more ETH than the required ante for the next level will survive and advance to the next stage. Wagers placed on surviving players will be rewarded with a share of the losing wagers.

The reward distribution favors bets on players with fewer total wager. If a player with less total wager survives, each spark bet on them will earn more than a spark bet on a player with more total wager. This creates an opportunity for higher returns when betting on less popular players who end up surviving.

For example, if two players survive, and one has significantly less total wager placed on them, each spark bet on that player will earn more than a spark bet on the player with more total wager.

Let's say we have 6 players competing in stage I, and approximately 1 player will be eliminated (assuming the losing wagers account for 25% of total wagers).
This is what the betting table could look like when you place your bet:

| Players   | Current Wager  | Approximate Odds |
| :---------| :------------- | :------------- |
| P1        | 700            |  1.65          | 
| P2        | 1400           |  1.325         |
| P3        | 2000           |  ...           |
| P4        | 2000           |  ...           |
| P5        | 2000           |  ...           |
| P6        | 2000           |  ...           |
| Total     | 7000           |  ...           |

Assuming the losing wager accounts for 25% of the total wager, the 5,250 winning wager will share 1,750 losing wager multiplied by the 1.3 Duper bonus, resulting in 2,275 sparks.

If one player is eliminated, the five winning wager will share the sparks equally: 2,275 / 5 = 455 sparks per winning wager.

- For P1, the odds are calculated as: (700 + 455) / 700 = 1.65
- For P2, the odds are calculated as: (1400 + 455) / 1400 = 1.325

The actual result may differ from this approximation. For example, at the end of round I, if P3 is eliminated:
- 5,000 winning wager will split 2,000 * 1.3 = 2,600 losing wager
- Each wager pot receives 2,600 / 5 = 520 sparks

If you bet 100 sparks on P1, you'd get (100 / 700) * 520 = 74.28 sparks profit, which is a 1.74 return on your investment.

## Final Match Betting

Final match differs from Stages I-II as it consists of one final game where competitors can earn varying amounts of money. The odds for this stage are based on the fraction of the final match prize each player wins.

The betting table you'll see assumes one player wins the entire prize. For example:

If P1 wins the entire final match prize (and no other player earns money):
- Total wager: 5800 sparks
- P1's current wager: 700 sparks
- Profit per spark wagered on P1:  (5800 - 700) * 1.3 / 700 = 9.47 sparks
- Odds for P1: 9.47 + 1 (got principal back) = 10.47

| Players   | Current Wager  | Maximal Odds |
| :---------| :------------- | :------------- |
| P1        | 700            |  10.47         | 
| P2        | 1300           |  ...           |
| P3        | 2000           |  ...           |
| P4        | 1000           |  ...           |
| P5        | 800            |  ...           |
| Total     | 5800           |  ...           |

The actual result will likely differ from the maximal odds shown. Here's an example:

Final game results:
- P1 wins $1000
- P2 wins $300
- P3 wins $200
- P4 and P5 lose

Calculations:
- Winning wager: 4000 sparks (P1, P2, P3)
- Losing wager: 1800 sparks (P4, P5)
- Adjusted losing wager: 1800 * 1.3 = 2340 sparks

Distribution and actual odds:
- P1: 1560 sparks (2/3 of 2340), odds: 3.23
- P2: 468 sparks (1/5 of 2340), odds: 1.36
- P3: 312 sparks (2/15 of 2340), odds: 1.16
