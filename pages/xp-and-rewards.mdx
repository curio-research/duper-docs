# XP and Rewards

## XP

XP is the bedrock of Duper's progression system. XP is non-transferrable. Players with high XP gain privileges in the future, including:

- Priority to participate in the first tournaments
- Priority to launch their \<redacted\> and earn from speculation
- Priority to trade other players' \<redacted\> before others
- Other exclusive benefits, both social and financial, in the Duper ecosystem

### How to Gain XP

You gain XP mainly from the following ways: achieving initial quests, playing games (especially ETH games), having positive net payout from games, and generally being a loyal and constructive participant in the Duper ecosystem. There may be opportunities to convert excess Sparks to XP as well.

All your XP and XP gains are displayed on your profile page. The initial quest checklist is also displayed there.

There will also be special events and promotions that will give you additional XP. Check Duper's home page often.

## Rewards

There are massive rewards for playing Duper, both on a regular basis and in special events and tournaments. Rewards are concentrated on Ranked games. The reward details are displayed on Duper's home page at all times. Events and tournaments with extra reward are always announced on Twitter/Discord in advance.
