# 🎄 Season VII

From November 17, 2025 to January 31, 2026 (2.5 months), a new season of Duper begins!

## 👨🏻‍💻 A Few Words from the Devs

It's been some time since Duper's first public launch. During this time, it's incredibly fun and humbling to see so much love and hate by the community for each other and for us. 

Every season, we strive to solve a few real pain points for both new and loyal players. This season is no different. For example, we've noticed that during days of low traffic, matchmaking can take longer than players are willing to wait, especially new players. We also noticed that some players otherwise enjoying the game are too scared of potential losses to proceed. We've designed Season 7 to address these issues—see below.

We remain convinced that a brainy social strategy game with real money like Duper is inevitable, and execute based on this conviction. Enjoy the new season!

## 🎉 What’s New

- ⚡️ **Blitzmatch**: Find a casual game in \<30 seconds guaranteed!

### FAQ: Should I buy the Gold Pass early or get it mid-season?

When you get the Gold Pass, based on your current points, you get all the rewards retroactively. However, for those days without the Gold Pass, you won't have loss raffles, in-game chat stickers, or short ranked matchmaking. So when you're ready to commit, get it early!
