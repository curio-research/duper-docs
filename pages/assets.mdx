# Assets

Welcome to the Duper economy! Here's everything you need to know about the different assets in our ecosystem.

## 💲 Dollars

Real U.S. dollars are used in game entry fees and prize pools.

You can top up or withdraw dollars from your account at any time. Note that withdrawals require a minimum of \$5 and are subject to a 7-day review period to prevent fraud.

## ✨ Sparks

Sparks are the primary currency in the Duper ecosystem. Use sparks to buy [Gold Keys](./lootboxes#how-to-open-a-lootbox) and extend your turn time. Buy sparks directly from the store, or earn them from season pass, quests, lootboxes, and limited-time events.

### Turn Time Extension

You can use sparks to extend your turn time up to 2 times per match.

- Casual (\$0.1 entry): 1st time 50 sparks, 2nd time 150 sparks
- Ranked (\$2 entry): 1st time 100 sparks, 2nd time 300 sparks
- Custom (at least \$2 entry): 1st time 100 sparks, 2nd time 300 sparks
- Duper League (\$10 entry): 1st time 200 sparks, 2nd time 600 sparks

## 🃏 Emblems

Emblems are special cards that can be used in-game to increase your risk and potential return.

Note: Higher rarity emblems are not strictly "better" than lower rarity ones, because the former typically require more emblem point and entry fees to use and therefore bring higher risk.

Below are the in-game mechanics of current emblems.

| Emblem Name       | \# Rarity | Emblem Points Needed | % Additional Entry Fee Relative to Current | Effects                      |

| Swift Architect   | Rare      | 3           | 15%                       | 50% completing center, 50% 3 gold             |

### Emblem Points

Everyone starts with 1 emblem point which increments by 1 every round. Every time a player uses emblems, everyone else's emblem points increment by 1.

In casual mode, emblem points don't increment every round, only from another player using emblems.

### Emblem Fragments

Think of emblem fragments as one-time use emblems. Every emblem has emblem fragments, and they are available from lootboxes, season pass, and bundles.

## 🎁 Lootboxes

Lootboxes are live starting in Season IV! Get Emblems, skins, and other rare items you'd like by acquiring Keys to open Lootboxes.

### What's inside a lootbox?

Each lootbox opens to exactly 1 item. Below are all possible items from a lootbox:

- Song fragment (3 to combine into a song)
- Emblem fragment
- Cody emote
- \$2-voucher
- Emblem

Note: Emblems are the rarest item in a lootbox, and they can only be opened using gold keys.

### How to open a lootbox?

Opening lootboxes requires keys. There are two types of keys: gold keys and silver keys.
