  - Phase 2: Bet on who will advance to the finals. Bets settled directly after phase 2.
  - Phase 3: Bet on the highest payout player of the finals
  - **The rewards favor bets on players with fewer total bets placed on them. If a player with less total bets survives, each chip bet on them will earn more than chips bet on a player with more total bets. This creates an opportunity for higher returns betting on less popular players who end up surviving.**
