# Duper Docs

## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.

## Deployment

Vercel deploys the `main` branch to docs.duper.gg, so make sure to push your changes to the `main` branch. In addition, if you've created new pages or updated the urls of existing ones, make sure to manually redeploy the newest Vercel deployment without cache in order to have correct linking.
